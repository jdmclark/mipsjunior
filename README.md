MIPS Junior
==========

MIPS Junior is a simple 16-bit instruction set architecture. It was created to teach intermediate-level computer architecture and digital logic. The instruction set likely originated from CS61C at UC Berkeley, but it has since been adapter for use by many other universities.

This package includes an assembler and simulator for MIPS Junior. The source code is available under the BSD 2-clause license.
